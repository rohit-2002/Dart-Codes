# Dart Basics: Control Flow Examples

This repository contains simple Dart programs demonstrating the usage of basic control flow structures. These examples help to understand how to implement loops and conditional statements in Dart.

## Projects

### 1. **Basic For Loop**
This example demonstrates how to use the `for` loop in Dart to iterate over a range of numbers.

### 2. **Basic While Loop**
This example demonstrates the usage of the `while` loop to execute a block of code as long as the condition is true.

### 3. **If-Else Statement**
This example shows how to use the `if-else` statement in Dart to make decisions based on conditions.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dart-basics.git
   cd dart-basics
2. **Run any of the Dart files:**
   ```bash
   dart basic_for.dart
   dart basic_while.dart
   dart if_else_statement.dart
